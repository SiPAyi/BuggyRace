# BuggyRace

## About the Competition

This repository is created for the "BuggyRace" competition organized by our innovation club, **IdeaForge**. The goal of this competition is to encourage students from our college to develop an interest in robotics, automation, and competitive problem-solving. Participants are expected to use this repository as the starting point to build and program their own robotic buggy for the race.


### Objectives of the Competition

- To foster creativity and innovation among students.
- To promote hands-on learning in robotics and programming.
- To encourage teamwork and collaboration through competition.
- To provide a platform for students to showcase their skills and compete at a college level.

We hope this competition inspires students to delve deeper into the world of robotics and engineering. Happy coding, and may the best team win!
